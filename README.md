Problem-1: We are given two arrays that represent the arrival and departure of trains, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required, and no.of trains need to wait
Sample input: arr[] = 9.00, 9.40, 9.50, 11.00, 15.00, 18.oo
              dep[] = 9.10, 12.00, 11.20, 11.30, 19.00, 20.00
Problem-2: A toy factory is packing toys into boxes. Each box can contain either a toy(Represented by an integer value) or be empty(Represented by 0) write a function to move all the empty boxes to the end of the array while maintaining the order of the toys and also return the count to empty boxes
Sample input: boxes = [1,0,3,0,6,7,0,2,4,0,8,0,0] 
Problem-3: Find the minimum no of arrows to burst ballons. Given a set of ballons each represented by a range start and find the minimum no of arrows required to burst multiple ballons if they overlap.
Sample input: {(10, 16) (2, 5) (5, 9)}
